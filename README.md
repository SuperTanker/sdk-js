## Overview

[The Tanker SDK](https://tanker.io) provides an easy-to-use SDK allowing you to protect your users' 
data. 

The Tanker SDK consists of the following packages, which are distributed on npm:

* `@tanker/client-browser` for Web applications
* `@tanker/client-node` for Node.js client applications


For more information about usage, visit the
[Tanker SDK guide](https://tanker.io/docs/latest/guide/getting-started/).


## Setup

If you want to build the Tanker SDK yourself, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

### Test and lint

Our codebase is using the following ES6 features: async/await, import/export, and classes with flow for type-checking and with eslint for linting.

# Verification UI for the Tanker SDK

A UI element that wraps a Tanker client in order to handle the verification process on its own. It takes the form of a modal that will appear as needed, send the verification code to the user and prompt them for said code.

## Usage

This package is meant to wrap a Tanker client and start it through the VerificationUI object.

```javascript
import { Tanker } from '@tanker/client-browser';
import VerificationUI from '@tanker/verification-ui';

const config = { trustchainId: <trustchain-id> };
const tanker = new Tanker(config);
const verificationUI = new VerificationUI(tanker);

const { email, identity, provisionalIdentity } = await myApp.getCurrentUser();

// This call will show the verification modal as required and will block until the user verifies their identity.
// `email` required, the email address to which emails will be sent to verify the user's identity
// `identity` required, the Tanker identity for the given user (generated by @tanker/identity)
// `provisionalIdentity` optional, a Tanker provisional identity that should be claimed by the user (generated by @tanker/identity). It only needs to be verified once and will be ignored if given again.
await verificationUI.start(email, identity, provisionalIdentity);
```
